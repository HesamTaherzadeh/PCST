# PCST
Photogrammetric Coordinate System Transformer, in short PCST, is a python based GUI program, that intends to help photogrammetrist and computer vision analyst, rapidly pick the best model and it's parameter on their data

# Some primitive photogrammetric definitions:

**Ground Control Points** :
- Ground control points (GCPs) are places on the ground that have a precise known location associated with them. In photogrammetry, they are used to tie the map down to the Earthâ€”matching the drone location data to the location data measured terrestrially.

**Independent check points**:
- Independent check points(ICPs) are used to assess the absolute accuracy of the model. The marks of the checkpoints are used to estimate its 3D position as well as potential errors in the clicks. This way, the relative accuracy of the area of the checkpoints may improve.

# Linear conformal
The simplest 2D mathematical model in analytical photogrammetry is 2D linear conformal or 2D similarity transformation
